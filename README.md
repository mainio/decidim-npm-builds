# Example for Decidim NPM builds

If we want to distribute Decidim NPM packages directly from GitHub, please see
the GitHub workflow included in this repository.

The workflow builds the Decidim NPM packages as tar packages and commits them
back to this repository when they have changed. Then, Decidim installations can
install them directly from the GitHub repository where they live at.
